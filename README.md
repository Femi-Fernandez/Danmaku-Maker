# Danmaku-Maker
 
This is the repo for my COMP3000 Final year project, Danmaku maker. It is an in-depth prototype bullet hell boss creator that allows the user to create, save and import other users bosses. 

## How to use
Arrow Keys: move the player
Z: fire
Left shift: Slow down movement

Drag and drop turrets onto the play scene to begin customising them. 
Make sure to save your turret settings on each subphase, otherwise the data will not be written to the storage file. 

## planned features
In the future, you can expect to see:
Updated UI
Play mode
Easier saving system
Currently saved data viewer
Rearrange placed turrets.
